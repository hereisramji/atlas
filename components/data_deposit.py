          - Licensing Bonus: \$5,000 - \$50,000 for high-impact datasets (e.g., cited in drug approvals).
        - **Deidentification Support**: Tools to ensure HIPAA/GDPR compliance.
        - **Attribution**: Optional credit in publications (e.g., "Data provided by XYZ Pharma").
        - **Example**: XYZ Pharma earns \$100 from 100 queries (\$1 each) \+ \$500 from 5\% of a \$10,000 subscription, totaling \$600 plus potential bonuses.
